# Wordle
<h4> Simple implementation of Wordle using Java / Apache NetBeans IDE 17. </h4>  
  

<h5>Game mechanics:</h5>
Player can type letters which are displayed in the screen (grid boxes), and delete inserted letters that by pressing backspace.
Player makes a guess by pressing enter (if all letters are typed in).  

Background colours of boxes containing letters change according to the players' guess:
- grey - guessed word does not contain inserted letter at all.
- orange - guessed word does contain inserted letter. 
- green - inserted letter matches with the corresponding letter in the guessed word.
